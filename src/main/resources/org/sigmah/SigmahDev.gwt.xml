<!--
  GWT module to use in development mode.
  It removes a lot a permutations (no permutation for fr and es locales, no permutation for webkit or old ie).
  It's mainly useful when executing 'mvn package -P sigmah-dev', not in development mode as permutations are done at runtime.
  Instead of 24 permutations, it will only produce 1 permutation.
